\title{Convert REDCap logic to R code.}
\usage{
convert_redcap2r(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A string containing REDCap logic.}
}
\value{
A string with containing valid R code (token) that can be parsed in it's current context into an R expression tree for evaluation.
}
\description{
Wrapper for converting REDCap branching logic to valid R code (for metaprogramming purposes).
}
\details{
REDCap data dictionaries contain logic encapsulated in the branching logic that affects data capture and hence data management and analysis.

These logic(s) have to be transformed into the appropriate analytical tool's DSL for consistent data munging and analysis.

In our case, this involves conversion from REDCap logic to R code.

This is a composite function made up of an aggregation of many smaller internal functions.
