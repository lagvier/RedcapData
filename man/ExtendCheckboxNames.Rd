}
\arguments{
\item{x}{String with REDCap logic possibly with embedded checkbox references.}

Preprocessed R code that can be refined further or valid R syntax that can be parsed into an expression tree for evaluation.
}
\description{
Expand REDCap branching logic and other code that include checkboxes to match indexing format used in underlying repository.

For code generation, code has to be translated from one DSL or syntax to another.

In this case, conversion from REDCap logic to the appropriate R syntax.

This function helps expand REDCap checkbox syntax eg chk(1) to the underlying data format expected in R eg chk___1
