\title{Convert REDCap string dates to R dates (code preparation).}
\usage{
convert_dates_red2r(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A string with REDCap logic, either raw or preprocessed.}
}
\value{
Preprocessed R code that can be refined further or valid R syntax that can be parsed into an expression tree for evaluation.
}
\description{
Date conversion from REDCap to R.
}
\details{
In REDCap logic, dates are represented as raw strings.

This is unlike R which requires objects to be of class `Date` for date-like operations to be carried out on the object.

This requires conversion to facilitate date-based operations.
